  <dcterms:title>Space is Awesome</dcterms:title>
  <dcterms:description>The Great Space Race was hotly anticipated as the follow-up to Legend's popular and influential graphic adventure Valhalla. Pre-release publicity boasted that the game contained "technical effects never before seen in home computer software", with "true solid 3D graphics".[2] The game was actually coded largely in BASIC.[3]&#xD;
&#xD;
After its release, the game was described by Sinclair User as "one of the most vacuous products we have seen."[4] The graphics also did not impress, as Big K magazine panned "Graphics are great - by 1982 standards. In 1985 they look amateurish and unprofessional".[5] Despite the heavy criticism at launch, the game has gained a cult status through the use of emulators in recent years.</dcterms:description>
